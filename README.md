# conference-tags
Create name tags with custom backgrounds. Used usually to create name tags for conferences / events.


Next steps:
1) Need to generalize the tag creator, move into a seperate file.
2) Create a properties that might even take positions, to allow for that freedom.
3) Add attributes that allow for more information to be displayed and pulled from the csv files. 
4) Add a fonts folder to allow for custom fonts. (Add that to the properties file)
